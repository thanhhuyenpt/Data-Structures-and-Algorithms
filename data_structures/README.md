# Introduction to Data Structures

## What is Data Structure?

* A data structure is **a particular way of organizing data** in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. 
* The main idea behind using data structures is to **minimize the time and space complexities**.
* It is used for **organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data**.

## Classification/Types of Data Structures

We can classify data structures in different ways based on the use case and properties.

### Primitive data structures
   
   * **A primitive data structure is full of bits representing the actual value of a variable**. In another definition, it is a fundamental building block of data structures, storing data of only one type or holding a single value in a specific memory location.
   * Example: **boolean** (true or false), **char** (16 bits), **byte** (8 bits), **short** (16 bits), **int** (32 bits), **long** (64 bits), **float** (32 bits), **double** (64 bits).

### Non-primitive data structures

  * Non-primitive data structures can **store more than one type of data in a contiguous or random memory location**.
  * Based on the order of organizing and accessing data, non-primitive data structures can be classified into two categories: Linear Data Structure, and Non-linear Data Structure
   
1. **Linear Data Structure**

    * Elements are arranged in one dimension (linear dimension).
    * Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

2. **Non-Linear Data Structure**

    * Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one, and many-many dimensions.
    * Example: tree, graph, table, etc.

## Most popular data structures:

In this repository, I will cover the following data structures:

* [Array](./array/)
* [String](./string/)
* [Linked List](./linked_list)
* [Matrix/Grid](./matrix_grid/)
* [Stack](./stack/)
* [Queue](./queue/)
* [Heap](./heap/)
* [Hash](./hash/)
* [Binary Tree](./binary_tree/)
* [Trie](./trie/)
* [Graph](./graph/)
* [Disjoint Set](./disjoint_set)
