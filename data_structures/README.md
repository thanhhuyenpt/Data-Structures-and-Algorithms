## What is Data Structure?

* A data structure is **a particular way of organizing data** in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. 
* The main idea behind using data structures is to **minimize the time and space complexities**.
* It is used for **organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data**.

## Classification/Types of Data Structures

1. Linear Data Structure
  
   * Elements are arranged in one dimension (linear dimension).
   * Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

2. Non-Linear Data Structure

    * Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one, and many-many dimensions.
    * Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
