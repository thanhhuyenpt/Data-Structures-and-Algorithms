# Introduction to Data Structures

## What is Data Structure?

* A data structure is **a particular way of organizing data** in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. 
* The main idea behind using data structures is to **minimize the time and space complexities**.
* It is used for **organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data**.

## Classification/Types of Data Structures

1. Linear Data Structure
  
   * Elements are arranged in one dimension (linear dimension).
   * Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

2. Non-Linear Data Structure

    * Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one, and many-many dimensions.
    * Example: tree, graph, table, etc.

## Most popular data structures:

In this repository, I will cover the following data structures:

* [Array](./array/)
* [String](./string/)
* [Linked List](./linked_list)
* [Matrix/Grid](./matrix_grid/)
* [Stack](./stack/)
* [Queue](./queue/)
* [Heap](./heap/)
* [Hash](./hash/)
* [Binary Tree](./binary_tree/)
* [Trie](./trie/)
* [Graph](./graph/)
* [Disjoint Set](./disjoint_set)
